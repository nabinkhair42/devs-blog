## Introduction

In this post, we'll explore how to build a minimal, performant blog using modern web technologies. The goal is to create something that's simple, fast, and easy to maintain.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js provides an excellent foundation for a blog:

- **Server-side rendering** for better SEO
- **Static site generation** for lightning-fast pages
- **File-based routing** for simplicity
- **Built-in optimization** for images and fonts

## MDX: The Best of Both Worlds

MDX combines the simplicity of Markdown with the power of React components:

```tsx
import { CustomComponent } from './components'

# Hello World

<CustomComponent>
  This is JSX inside Markdown!
</CustomComponent>
```

## Key Features

1. **Fast**: Static generation means instant page loads
2. **Simple**: Write in Markdown, deploy anywhere
3. **Flexible**: Add React components when needed
4. **Minimal**: Clean design focused on content

## Code Example

Here's a simple React component:

```javascript
function BlogPost({ title, date, content }) {
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      <time>{date}</time>
      <div>{content}</div>
    </article>
  )
}
```

## Conclusion

Building a blog doesn't have to be complicated. With the right tools, you can create something beautiful and functional in no time.

Happy coding! 🚀
